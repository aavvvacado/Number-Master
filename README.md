## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design Patterns

### State Management
- **BLoC Pattern**: Implemented using `flutter_bloc` for reactive state management
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Clean separation between UI events and business logic
- **Immutable State**: Game state is immutable, ensuring predictable state transitions

### Core Components
- **GameLogic**: Main game logic class handling all game mechanics
- **NumberMasterLogic**: Enhanced logic engine with advanced features
- **GameCell**: Immutable cell representation with Equatable for efficient comparisons
- **GameLevel**: Configurable level system with progressive difficulty

## üß† Game Logic Features

### 1. Self-Matching Prevention ‚úÖ
**Implementation**: Enhanced cell selection system with proper validation
```dart
// Prevents selecting the same cell twice
if (selectedCellIndex == index) {
  selectedCellIndex = null;
  highlightedCells.clear();
  return false;
}
```

**Key Features**:
- Tracks `selectedCellIndex` to prevent same cell selection
- Enhanced `selectCell()` method with proper validation
- Multiple checks in `areCellsAMatch()` and `isValidPair()` to prevent self-matching
- Cell deselection when tapped twice


**Key Features**:
- `GameState` class for comprehensive state management
- `gameHistory` list with configurable size (50 states by default)

### 3. Enhanced Game Mechanics ‚úÖ
**Implementation**: Strategic number placement and matching algorithms
```dart
// Target-based level completion
static bool isLevelCompleted() {
  return matchesFound >= targetMatches;
}
```

**Key Features**:
- Better selection highlighting system
- Move counter and match tracking
- Target-based level completion system
- Strategic number placement algorithms
- Enhanced scoring with higher bonuses

### 4. Increased Difficulty Scaling ‚úÖ
**Implementation**: Dynamic difficulty adjustment based on level progression
```dart
// More targets required: Dynamic target calculation (60% of board)
targetMatches = (nonNullCells * 0.6).ceil();

// Larger grids: Enhanced generateRandomBoard() with 80% fill rate
int filledCells = (totalCells * 0.8).ceil();
```

**Key Features**:
- **More targets required**: Dynamic target calculation (60% of board)
- **Larger grids**: Enhanced `generateRandomBoard()` with 80% fill rate
- **More cells per row**: 30% increase in `generateNewRow()`
- **Strategic number distribution**: Weighted generation favoring challenging combinations
- **Additional numbers**: 30% more numbers added when reshuffling

### 5. Advanced Matching Rules ‚úÖ
**Implementation**: Complex adjacency and connection validation
```dart
// Check if two indexes can connect diagonally through empty cells
static bool canConnectDiagonally(int i, int j) {
  // Diagonal connection logic with path validation
}

// Check if two indexes can wrap from end of row to start of next row
static bool canWrap(int i, int j) {
  // Row wrapping logic
}
```

**Key Features**:
- **Horizontal adjacency**: Cells in same row, adjacent columns
- **Vertical adjacency**: Cells in same column, adjacent rows
- **Diagonal adjacency**: Cells diagonally adjacent
- **Diagonal connections**: Through empty cells with path validation
- **Row wrapping**: From end of row to start of next row

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Board Representation
- **Flexible Grid System**: Configurable row length with dynamic sizing
- **Index Mapping**: Efficient conversion between row/col and linear indices
- **State Persistence**: Complete board state saved for undo/redo operations

### Cell Selection System
```dart
static bool selectCell(int index) {
  // Enhanced selection with self-match prevention
  // Proper state management and validation
}
```

### Pair Validation
```dart
static bool isValidPair(int i, int j) {
  // Comprehensive validation including:
  // - Value matching (equal or sum to 10)
  // - Adjacency rules
  // - Connection validation
  // - Self-matching prevention
}
```

### Hint System
```dart
static List<int>? getHint() {
  // Finds all possible valid pairs
  // Returns first available match
  // Integrates with NumberMasterLogic
}
```

## üìä Game Statistics & Tracking

### Score System
- **Base Score**: 10 points per successful match
- **Clear Bonus**: 200 points for complete board clear
- **Level Completion**: 100 points for reaching target matches
- **Cycle Bonus**: 50 points for completing a cycle

### Progress Tracking
- **Move Counter**: Tracks total moves made
- **Match Counter**: Tracks successful matches
- **Target System**: Dynamic target calculation based on board size
- **Level Progression**: Automatic level advancement

## üéØ Level System

### Dynamic Difficulty
- **Progressive Complexity**: Each level increases in difficulty
- **Adaptive Targets**: Target matches calculated as 60% of board cells
- **Strategic Placement**: Numbers placed to create challenging combinations
- **Enhanced Grids**: Larger grids with more cells per row

### Level Configuration
```dart
class GameLevel {
  final int levelNumber;
  final int initialRowCount;
  final int minCellsPerRow;
  final int maxCellsPerRow;
  final int requiredMatches;
}
```

## üîÑ State Management Integration

### BLoC Integration
- **Event Handling**: `CellTapped`, `UndoRequested`, `RedoRequested`
- **State Updates**: Reactive UI updates based on game state changes
- **Error Handling**: Proper error states and user feedback

### Game State Synchronization
```dart
// Synchronizes GameCell list with NumberMasterLogic board
static void _syncBoardWithNumberMasterLogic(List<GameCell> cells, int rowLength) {
  // Converts GameCell list to board representation
  // Maintains consistency between UI and logic layers
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Features

### Debugging Tools
```dart
static void printBoard() {
  // Comprehensive board visualization
  // Shows selection state, score, moves, and progress
  // Enhanced debugging with visual indicators
}
```

### Error Handling

- **Null Safety**: Comprehensive null checking throughout
- **State Validation**: Ensures consistent state across operations

## üì± User Interface Features

### Visual Feedback
